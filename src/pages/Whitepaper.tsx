          <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">The Timeless Appeal of Chess</h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Chess, with a history spanning over 1500 years, has captivated minds across cultures and generations. Its blend of strategy, foresight, and intellect has made it a universal symbol of cognitive prowess. Today, chess thrives in the digital age, attracting traditional enthusiasts and new players seeking intellectual challenges.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            However, despite its global popularity, chess remains undermonetized for most players. While elite grandmasters earn from sponsorships and tournaments, millions of skilled players receive no rewards for their time and expertise. Pawns aims to change that.
